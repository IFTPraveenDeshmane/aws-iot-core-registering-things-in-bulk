# Smart Waste Management System

COnventional waste collections are complicated and costly. A fleet of trucks drive along busy streets on an arbitrary schedula using inefficient routes. Wiht no data, collections are based on a lot of speculations. At any given time waste bins vary in fill levels.

IoT sensors can be retrofitted to existing bins of any size and shape with ability to detect solid or liquid substances. Once installed, sensors communicate to online platform where fill levels can be monitored on visual graphs and collection routes are optimzed. 
 
By implementing smart solutions in waste management systes, pickup points are minimized so fewer vehicles are dispatched resulting in less trafic noise, congestion and CO2 emission.

Optimized routes can be updated on the drivers app whenever new data is retriveved. Drivers follow the deisgnated route and empty bins that have been highlighted.

With this solution, less time , less trucks and less fuel will be nedeed for the operations resolving a saving up to 80 percent.[Ecube Labs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bazmkSKD5fk)
